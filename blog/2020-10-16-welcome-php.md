Hello ðŸ‘‹

Am happy to announce today we have version 0.0.1 of Pesa SDK for PHP

<!-- truncate -->
It supports the following features (via synchronous requests)

- customer to business (C2B) single payment
- business to customer (B2C) single payment
- payment reversals (pr)
- query transaction status 
- direct debit creation (ddc) 
- direct debit payments(ddp)

Currently, we only have SDK for PHP we are looking forward to supporting Javascript next.
Please find some documentation for the SDK, not much but its start, link at the bottom

If you have any question or inquiry, am available and happy to help.

More testing is required, check and try the examples, feedback is  highly appreciated,
