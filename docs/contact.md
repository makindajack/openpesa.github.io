## Forum ðŸ“‹

Our preferred method of communication is our forum on GitHub Discussions (opens new window)(beta hype!). Asynchronous long-form discussion enables our increasingly distributed team and community to communicate across multiple timezones with minimal repetition.

Your project announcements, feature proposals, support queries and sweet, sweet praise all belongs in the forum.

## Chat ðŸ’¬

Prefer the speed and fluidity of chat? Then join our [Telegram community](https://t.me/openpesa) .

We think chat and forum discussions are highly complementary , happily co-existing as two different modes of conversation. Try use the right tool for the job; but most importantly we just want to hear from you, regardless of medium!

## GitHub Issues ðŸ”©

Bug reports should be added as issues in the corresponding repository, e.g. [openpesa/php-pesa](https://github.io/openpesa/php-pesa), [openpesa/pesa-js](https://github.io/openpesa/pesa-js) (opens new window)and so forth.

## Email ðŸ’Œ

Prefer a good old email? For a private conversation, you may message us at alphaolomi@gmail.com. English or Swahili is welcome! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· (+ ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¿)

Any suggestion or feedback is highly appreciated. Thank you for your support!
