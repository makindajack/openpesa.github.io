## ðŸ”§ Development

### Installation

```console
yarn install
```

### Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.


If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
